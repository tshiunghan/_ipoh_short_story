◊heading{Ipoh Short Story}

Once upon a time in Ipoh, a guy from KL came up for the weekend
and wrote a short story for a festival. The ◊emph{weekend}.

He really wanted to join this writing workshop.

The date was ◊(get-date).

He really wanted to go, but he didn't want to spend any money.

He was broke. He had lost his job. His girlfriend had left him.
