I was thirsty. I wanted a glass of water. I got up from my bed and walked to the kitchen. Poured myself a glass. Walked back to my room and lay down again.

The room was spinning. 

Once upon a time in Ipoh, a guy from KL came up for the weekend
and wrote a short story for a festival. The ◊emph{weekend}.

He really wanted to join this writing workshop.

The date was ◊(get-date).

He really wanted to go, but he didn't want to spend any money.

He was broke. He had lost his job. His girlfriend had left him.

What made matters worse: he had been hit by a car.

The flavor in my mouth is salmon, pistacho. My tongue rolls the piece of avocado around my mouth, to get a feel for the place. I felt at a very young age that I would taste more of something the more I kept it in my mouth. I would keep grapes in my mouth for hours. I felt at a very young age that I would taste more of something the more of it I put in my mouth. Taking grapes again as an example, I would cram my mouth full of grapes until I was no longer able to swallow and the saliva dribbled down my chin. I would take a few grapes out of my mouth, but I would continue on my quest for flavor. 

Once I could close my mouth, I would blow a grap out of my the mouth like blowing a kiss.
